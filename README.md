# My dotfiles

Mostly things I experiment with. Some of them I use daily, some I set
and forget, some I haven't looked at or changed in a long time.

There's really world changing here, it's just my
playground. Files here are subject to change at any time.

If you find something useful, help yourself. Nothing here is guaranteed
to work, so consider yourself **warned**.
