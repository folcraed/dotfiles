# My dotfiles

Mostly things I experiment with. Some of them I use daily, some
I try out and go back to once in a while to see how they've improved.

There's really nothing fancy or world changing here, it's just my
playground. Files here are subject to change at any time.

If you find something useful, help yourself. Nothing here is guaranteed
to work, so consider yourself **warned**.
